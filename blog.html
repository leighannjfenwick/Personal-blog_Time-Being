      <h3>January 2026</h3>
      <p class="newsletter-date">Smithers, British Columbia</p>

      <h3>Daylight check-in</h3>
      <p>
        The days are getting infinitesimally longer. Here in Smithers today,
        sunrise is at 8:51 a.m. and sunset at 4:17 p.m. We still have a ways to go
        before the light really returns, but the daylight minutes are ticking up — slowly and steadily.

      <h3>A thought for the moment</h3>
      <p>
        As we move into a new year (and 2026 has a nice, even ring to it), instead
        of making resolutions, I’ve been thinking about what I can let go of to
        feel a little lighter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently came across a line from Mel Robbins about peace coming from
        releasing the need to control what was never ours to carry in the first
        place. That idea has been staying with me. I’m trying to loosen my grip
        on the belief that everything needs to be earned the hard way, and to make
        a bit more room for ease.
