            <h3>Demon Copperhead</h3>
            <p><em>by Barbara Kingsolver</em></p>
            <p>“A ten-year-old getting high on pills. Foolish children. This is what we're meant to say: Look at their choices, leading to a life of ruin. But lives are lived right now, this hour, down in the dirty cracks between the toothbrushed nighty-nights and the full grocery carts, where those words don't pertain. Children, choices. Ruin, that was the labor and materials we were given to work with. An older boy that never knew safety himself, trying to make us feel safe. We had the moon in the window to smile on us for a minute and tell us the world was ours. Because all the adults had gone off somewhere and left everything in our hands.” p.76</p>
            <p>"I was a strange new being, turned overnight. Creaky liked to call us orphan boys, and I always felt proud inside for not actually being one. So that was me doing the same, building the wall with me still on the lucky side. Now I'd gone over to the side of pitiful, and you never saw a kid so wrecked." p.110</p>
            <p> I asked how they came up with so much to say. He said they told each other everything they cared about, everything that got them sad, and what made them happiest. That was about it. He said between those three, they could probably keep going till the end of time. If not, they'd come up with another category. He couldn't have known he was putting a fist in my chest, telling me that. Poor Tommy, I'd been thinking, with his imaginary girl, while Dori and I had our fuck-fests. Then Dori and I had moved on to the fuck-yous, with no more categories out there that I could foresee. Tommy had something I never would." p.439</p>
            <p>"I never realized what was holding me to my place on the planet of earth: that soundtrack." p.514</p>

            <p>“Everyone is ugly. I should know. I look at people all day.
              They come to me with their faces. Shoving themselves forward. Demanding something be done. Wanting me to do something about it. Anything, anything really. "Please," they say.
              Now, I don't do magic. I can't make things appear or disappear. I can only work with what's in front of me.

It was there, steady and solid in the laughter and talk of the television and with her in the grocery aisles on weekends. It was there every night, in the dark, spectacular and sprawling in the quiet. And it all belonged to her.”</p>

This apparently impossible contradiction, made apparent and possible, still fascinated Morag, even after the years of river watching.” p.3 </p>

We'll follow a charismatic leader if they tell us we have a legitimate grievance. That they'll give us back our dignity. Our threatened way of life. If we follow them, our enemies will be vanquished and we will be heros. Who doesn't want to be part of something bigger than ourselves? Who doesn't want to be a hero? Even if it's fabricated.

And she was reminded that while some of the lines down his face were certainly caused by pain and sorry, stress and grief, by far the deepest impressions were made by just this. Smiling. Like lines on a map, these chartered the longitude and latitude, the journey of a man who had found happiness.
              Though there was the deep scar at his temple, which cut across the other lines.” p.3 </p>
